        <h1>REGISTER FOR MARCH MATHNESS!</h1>
        <p>
          Ready to register for March Mathness? Gather a team of one to four Timberline High School Students
          and <a href="https://forms.gle/9iytdavMphM666zs5" target="_blank">complete the registration form</a>
          by the end of the day on March 9, 2026.
          (NOTE: You may have noticed you can have a 'team' of one participant. 
          March Mathness participants are certainly encouraged to collaborate with others, but in the 
          spirit of inclusion, 'lone-wolf' competitors are welcome.)
        </p>
        <p>
          While you're at it, help spread the word by printing <a href="documents/THS_March_Madness_Signup.pdf" target="_blank">the informational flyer</a> and sharing the word!
          See Mr. Fogdall in room 213 with any questions. Have fun forming teams, and get ready for the Mathness to
          start March 11, 2026!
